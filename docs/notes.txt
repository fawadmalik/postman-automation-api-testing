- Importance of service API testing
- You need to test your service APIs and your SAPIs should have their own thorough test cycles. You may expand your application into a service API. Or, you may consume someone elseâ€™s service API. In order to guarantee the behavior of your own service API and to ensure that your application, which depends on a third-party service API, behaves as expected, learn to test your service APIs.
- This will improve the quality of your services through test automation.
